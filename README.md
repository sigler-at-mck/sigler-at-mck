# Hi, I'm Robert!
I manage the Computer Operations Team (Healthcare Operations) at [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/) Pharmacy & Affordability, a division of McKesson. I've worked at [McKesson](https://www.mckesson.com) for over 14 years in Linux Systems Engineering, Systems Engineering Manager, and Operations Manager.

## Nerd Creds
I've spent most of my [career](https://rsigler.com/) in Systems Engineering (Windows, UNIX, VMWare ESX, and Linux). After taking and passing the [Red Hat Performance Tuning](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcs-performance-tuning) exam, I decided to move into a leadership position, managing teams of cross-discipline technologists. I lead an IT operations organization at McKesson and love the challenge in my current role. My leadership philosophy focuses on the three concepts: empowerment, mentorship, and inclusion.

I started programming when I was about seven years old, mastering BASIC and then moving to Pascal, VisualBasic, and C. I also taught myself a bit of C++ and Assembly. Throughout my career, I've used other languages like C#, Java, Perl and have made extensive use of Python, Javascript, and most recently, Go. I'm an expert in all things Linux and can find my way around a Windows system if I have to. My primary desktop system runs Fedora Linux, and I love using my Macbook Air M1 for side projects.

## Projects & Code
In my role as a people leader, most of my code relates to data parsing and light analytics (usually to normalize data before importing it into a data visualization platform). I'm also interested in automation and workflow efficiencies. Most of my code is not intended for general release and will spend most of its life in private repositories. However, I'm happy to partner with other McKesson colleagues. I do share publically share code snips and HOWTOS via Gists and will publically share non-proprietary code.
